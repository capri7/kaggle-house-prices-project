    "# Kaggle House Prices Prediction\n",
    "This repository contains code and resources for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. \n",
    "This project was developed as part of the Kaggle competition \"House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this project, we use various machine learning algorithms to predict the final price of houses based on various features. \n",
    "The dataset contains features such as the size of the house, the number of rooms, the year it was built, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "To run this project, you need the following dependencies:\n",
    "- Python 3.8+\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- scikit-learn\n",
    "- matplotlib\n",
    "- seaborn\n",
    "- jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install the required packages using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt \n"
